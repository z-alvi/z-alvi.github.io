        <h1> Zoha's first CSC 196-W Webpage!</h1>
        <p>
            This webpage is dedicated to talking about <strong>soccer</strong> which is a topic that I have always found to be very interesting. 
            Soccer is a sport that I played for 11 years as well as one that I grew up watching my older sister play. It is a sport in which both teams have 11 players and a common goal of
            getting the ball into their opponents goal without any use of their hands. <strong>It is one of the most popular sports in the world.</strong> Here is a <a href="https://www.bundesliga.com/en/faq/all-you-need-to-know-about-soccer"title="more about soccer"target="_blank">link</a> to a helpful article 
            detailing more about this sport.
